Hosted by choreographer, director and certified somatic sexologist Gerard X Reyes (he/they), each episode features sexuality experts who offer to shed light on the behind-the-scenes work and tell personal stories to expand our preconceived notions about sex, sex work and the sensual body.",

        "text": "Pina Brutal is a film director, performer, and ex-stripper. Her performance art work deals with the topic of sexuality from an absurd and humourous perspective. While she was living in Berlin her research brought her to explore the world of stripping – both as a job and for one of her films. What unravelled is a journey into herself that took her from trauma to bliss. Here she offers the keys that unlocked her transformation."
