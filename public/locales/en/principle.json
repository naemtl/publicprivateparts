        "emma-simon": "Gerard Reyes offers us an ode to pleasure. The joy of dancing, of listening to music, of abandoning oneself to a sensual game of seduction is at the core of the work. And it becomes more touching. After he disrobes, the dancer reveals a beautiful intimacy; admirably lit by Karine Gauthier. In addition to questioning theatre conventions, one cannot avoid considering the conventions of stripping and voguing. What do these forms mean when extracted from the contexts we are used to seeing them in? Reyes takes all of the elements out of their stranglehold. They seem to be linked back together through their common essence, a limitless pleasure.",
        "marine-durand": "This body, as feminine as it is masculine, beautifully sculpted, enchants the gaze. [...] Clearly, Gerard Reyes knows how to turn his audience upside down and take them out of their comfort zone, just as he marvelously extracts himself from the codes of representation."
    },
    "text-discovery": "Reyes found pleasure in many places: Manhattan vogue balls, Portland strip clubs, a Montreal trans bar and Berlin play parties. Each place offered him an escape from social norms but each one also came with its own restrictive house rules. In “The Principle of Pleasure”, Reyes uses the theatre as a place capable of transcending limits to share his first true pleasure – dancing to the seductive songs of Janet Jackson. Voguing, stripping, glorifying eccentricity and embodying glamour open up the floor to exploring the controversial power of pleasure. Together performer and audience erase the borders that divide them to find ecstasy within and between their bodies."
