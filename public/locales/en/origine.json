        "paragraph-main-1": "<i>The Origin of the World</i> may be the starting point for a global history of moral censorship in modern times. In Paris 1866, Gustave Courbet’s painting was hidden from public view right after it had been completed. The work – which displays a woman’s abdomen, genitals, and legs – was seen more as a pornographic object than as a work of art. It was sold and resold many times but remained hidden until its first public exhibition in New York in 1988, when it became world famous. Then in 2011, Facebook censored the work again, this time online, under its “Community Guidelines”. What would happen if our human society could learn to accept the sensual body? What if we acknowledged the body as a precious resource for cultivating sensation, connection, and empathy with each other, with the world and with ourselves?",
        "paragraph-main-2": "<i>Public / Private Parts ou L’Origine du monde</i> is a dance performance and video installation which looks beyond the limiting binaries of public/private and art/pornography. A community of nine embodiment experts from various professional and cultural backgrounds create mindful body practices to awaken the senses. Through live performances and documentary videos, the group of contemporary dancers, sex workers, and sex educators, explore alone and expand together using the essential bodily functions of touch, breath, sound, movement, and imagination. Intimate and innovative, their discoveries reveal new, hopeful interconnections that could benefit us all.",

        "pat-white": "It's the end of the FTA 2021. A grandiose and intimate end at the same time thanks to the presentation of the work Public/Private Parts or L'Origine du monde by Gerard X Reyes which questions intimacy, pleasure and sexual limits with respect and kindness. [...] A real favourite which, I hope, will be presented on international stages. Thank you Justin Gionet, Emmanuel Proulx and Gerard X Reyes for sharing these precious moments.",
        "spirale-magazine": "By thus reinvesting the tactile and sensual dimension of their corporeality, the performers remind us that touching another person with respect is inevitably an act of reciprocity, and that this equality takes place in a form of sharing that alters the subject who submits to it. [...] The communion which is established between the performers and audience is supported by the musicality of the show: through the captivating rhythm of the soundtrack by Bendik Giske and Devon Bate, but also through the physical rhythm, the performers’ breath, which absorbs us and draws us into an immersive experience and practices to which they devote themselves before our eyes.",
        "jeu-revue": "Sensory masterpiece [...] It is singularly liberating. [...] Brilliantly executed. [...] Surrounded by performers in the flesh and by generous and fascinating virtual performers, Gerard X Reyes offers an undeniably sublime and important show. Liberating and destabilizing, this work offers us a view of ourselves. It takes hold beneath our skin, it settles there and it births life."
