                        This series of interviews follows Gerard X Reyes as they meet with Berlin-based sex workers, sex
                        educators and artists
                        to ask for their perspectives on the sensual/sexual body. These interviews took place in Montreal,
                        Berlin and ZÃ¼rich
                        between 2017 and 2019. Gerard was curious to better understand their experiences of working with
                        intimacy and to search
                        for links between these seemingly disparate professions. Meet 7 intriguing interviewees and be inspired
                        by their
                        refreshing views on relationships, sex and society.
