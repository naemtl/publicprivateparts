                <h2>Society’s Relationship To Pleasure</h2>
                <p> We all set limits on the quantity and quality of pleasure we can embody. Limits to pleasure are ubiquitous
                    in a culture that shames sexuality and fails to teach us how to honour and celebrate our erotic selves.
                    Sexual wounding becomes embedded in the body’s tissues and responses. Somatic Sex Education and Bodywork can
                    assist clients in expanding the pleasure that is possible. This expansion has physical, mental, emotional,
                    and relational benefits. </p>
                <p> In 2019, I graduated from the esteemed <a href="https://instituteofsomaticsexology.com">Institute of Somatic
                    Sexology</a> in Australia to become a Certified Sexological Bodyworker. I warmly welcome people of all
                    genders, races, cultures, religions, sexual orientations and relationship choices to work with me. </p>
                <h2>What Is Somatic Sex Education?</h2>
                <p> Sexological Bodyworkers teach embodied sex education and offer bodywork. We teach through body experiences
                    designed to nurture, deepen or awaken the sensual self. Our teaching can include coaching in breathwork,
                    body awareness, movement, boundary-setting (consent), communication, anatomy, massage, mindful masturbation,
                    scar tissue remediation and other body-based practices. </p>
                <p> Not all teachings include touch, but when requested touch is one-way (from practitioner to client) and is
                    client-led. We touch in ways that assist clients in developing presence within the body, opening interior
                    awareness, empowering choice and voice, and learning how the body can feel safer and more alive. Uniquely in
                    the profession, we are trained to offer client-led genital or anal touch for the purposes of education,
                    healing and pleasure. Sexological Bodyworkers are trauma-informed and remain clothed during sessions. </p>

                <h2>What happens in a session?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <span>Check-in</span> – You and Gerard discuss your intentions, interests, challenges and
                        sensual/sexual history.

                    <li>
                        <span>Body Scan</span> – Gerard leads you in a somatic body scan to bring awareness to
                        sensations in your body. This practice helps with learning to make choices
                        from an embodied place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Options</span> – Based on the check-in and body scan Gerard will offer you 2 options for
                        bodywork or somatic practices that could be useful based on your specific

                    <li>
                        <span>Integration</span> – The session ends with a few minutes of integration to ‘save’ the learning
                        experience in your nervous system (mind and body), thus forming new
                        healthy habits and expanding your potential for pleasure.

                    <h2>Message from Gerard</h2>
                    <p>As a non-binary and queer person (he/she/they), it has taken me decades of work to feel comfortable in my
                        skin. Over 20
                        years of training in dance, somatics, yoga and meditation helped me discover pleasure in my body. But it
                        wasn’t until my
                        training in Sexological Bodywork that I was given the tools to truly listen to it. I use this awareness
                        to make choices
                        that have improved both my sexual and everyday life.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2019, I became a Certified Sexological Bodyworker by completing a six-month course at the Australian <a href="https://instituteofsomaticsexology.com/">Institute of
                        Somatic Sexology</a>, which was facilitated by master educators Deej Juventin and Uma Ayelet. In
                        2020, I continued my
                        studies via a mentorship with Ron Stuart and Pono Stuart – two Certified Sexological Bodyworkers who are
                        associated with
                        the Institute for the Study of Somatic Sex Education in Victoria, Canada.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am interested in offering experiences that expand consciousness and create deeper connections between
                        body, mind and
                        spirit. I warmly welcome people of all genders, races, cultures, religions, sexual orientations and
                        relationship choices
                        to work with me.
